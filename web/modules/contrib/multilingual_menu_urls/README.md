# Multilingual Menu Links

The "link" field for menu items is not translatable. This is fine
for internal links since Drupal knows which version to reference
automatically.

This can be a problem for external links, as there might be a need
to provide a different URL based on the link language.

This module creates a "Provide Translated External Link" option in
the menu link form for translated items.

When enabled, it replaces the Link and Title fields with versions
that are language specific.

The current recommendation is to create language specific menus.
This module eliminates the need for that.

### Requirements

No special requirements. Requires menu_link_content from Drupal core.

### Install

Install module via composer or via standard Drupal module install
practices.

```bash
composer require drupal/multilingual_menu_urls
```

Enable via Drush:

```bash
drush en multilingual_menu_urls
```
